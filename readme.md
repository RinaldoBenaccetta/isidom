# Isi

## Introduction
The first goal of isi is to maximise minification of vanilla dom manipulation, and also ease of use.
Isi should replace method, chained methods and values for optimisation of minification.
Isi should stay simple and light. For lightweight, no errors should be throw by isi, nor validation for input types.
